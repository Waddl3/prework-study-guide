        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage: 
            inline CSS, internal CSS 
            style sheet, 
            & external CSS style sheet</li>
            <li>internal style sheet - CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
            <li>external style sheet - It is preferred in most cases. Allowing developer to keep all their CSS rules in a seprate file, 
              making the design changes much easier.</li>
              <li>link - in order to link something, you must put a * following { to open. <br>
              Place the link in between the 'head' element and then below the last 'meta' and above the 'title' element.</li>
            <li>Declaration contain two important components: propety 'color' and the value 'blue'.</li>
            <li>margin - property indicates how much space we want around the <strong><i>OUTSIDE</i></strong> of an element.</li>
            <li>padding - odten confused with margin, adds space around the content <strong><i>INSIDE</i></strong> an element.</li>
            <li>star (*) - is what we want to apply a rule to all the elements vidible on the page. Casuing <strong><i>ALL</i></strong> of the elements on the page
            to have the style properties 'margin' and 'padding' set as 0.</li>
            <li>DRY - <strong><i>Do Not Repeat Yourself.</i></strong></li>
            <li>'h1' ,'h2' rule assignment is a positioning property 'text-align'.<br>
              *helps with centering a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
            <li>'img' selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. 'display' property assigned with the 'block' value. each image to start on a new line.
            </li>
            <li>'ul' elements declares the font to be 20px and padding on th eleft of the unordered list to be 40px.</li>
            <li>'link' - creates the connection to external file. <br>
              In order to link the style.css, you want to use the 'link...'' in between the 'head' and above the 'title' and below the last 'meta'.</li>
            <li>'rel' - specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
            <li>'href' - using a relative path; the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html).</li>
            <li>to locate the style sheet from the current location, must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.</li>
            <li>Any additional notes can found in the bootcamp folder or notepad.</li>
        </ul>
