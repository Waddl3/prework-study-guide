      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>JokJoker
        <li>The head elemnt contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shwon to the user.</li>
        <li> ul is unordered lists, while li is list items.</li>
        <li> The 'p' is paragrph and goes within the body section.</li>
        <li> There are different header sizes: h1 - h6, biggest to smallest. </li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage:
          inline CSS, internal CSS
          style sheet,
          & external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>internal style sheet - CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>external style sheet - It is preferred in most cases. Allowing developer to keep all their CSS rules in a
          seprate file,
          making the design changes much easier.</li>
        <li>link - in order to link something, you must put a * following { to open. <br>
          Place the link in between the 'head' element and then below the last 'meta' and above the 'title' element.
        </li>
        <li>Declaration contain two important components: propety 'color' and the value 'blue'.</li>
        <li>margin - property indicates how much space we want around the <strong><i>OUTSIDE</i></strong> of an element.
        </li>
        <li>padding - odten confused with margin, adds space around the content <strong><i>INSIDE</i></strong> an
          element.</li>
        <li>star (*) - is what we want to apply a rule to all the elements vidible on the page. Casuing
          <strong><i>ALL</i></strong> of the elements on the page
          to have the style properties 'margin' and 'padding' set as 0.</li>
        <li>DRY - <strong><i>Do Not Repeat Yourself.</i></strong></li>
        <li>'h1' ,'h2' rule assignment is a positioning property 'text-align'.<br>
          *helps with centering a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
        <li>'img' selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. 'display' property assigned with
          the 'block' value. each image to start on a new line.
        </li>
        <li>'ul' elements declares the font to be 20px and padding on th eleft of the unordered list to be 40px.</li>
        <li>'link' - creates the connection to external file. <br>
          In order to link the style.css, you want to use the 'link...'' in between the 'head' and above the 'title' and
          below the last 'meta'.</li>
        <li>'rel' - specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
        <li>'href' - using a relative path; the location is derived from the current location (in this case,
          index.html).</li>
        <li>to locate the style sheet from the current location, must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.
        </li>
        <li>Any additional notes can found in the bootcamp folder or notepad.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>var [variable name] - This will cause it to be a unique reference that will be used later.
          We then us the ' = ' to assign the specific data that we want to store in our variable.
          After the ' = ', we enter a container named: 
          <p class = "indent">var [variable name] = [container name] </p>
        </li>
        <li>console.log - is a method to the file. We can use the 'console.log' method to output a message to the web
          console by adding an argument.
          The word 'console' refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.
        </li> 
        <li> The second part, ' .log() ' is a method. Meaning a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.
          It will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.
        </li>
        <li>We now link it: 
          <p class = "indent">
          We add the ' link' inside of the ' head ' element. Which contains metadata or meta information for the
          browser.
          </p>
          **Add the javascript under the ' footer ' section just under the closing footer and above the closing body. **
        </li>
        <li>array - a signle variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that
          is related in some way:
          <p class = "indent">var shape = "circle"; //this holds only one.
          <p class = "indent">var shapes = ["triangle, "square", "pentagon", "circle"]; // this represents a group.</p>
        </li>
        <li>String - in order to make strings, it needs to be contained within quotation marks.
          <p class = "indent">Example: var studentInfo = "Lu";
          <p class = "indent">Since the name is Lu, we put " " quotations to mark it as a string.
          <p class = "indent">If we had:
          var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];
          We do not put quotations on 54 since it is a number and true because it is a boolean value.</p>
          <strong><em>IMPORTANT:</em></strong>
          <p class = "indent"><strong> Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with differnt data types in a single variable, but
            not all arrays must have multiple data types. The array that we will add to our project only contains
            strings.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>array index - to work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of
          informations:
          <p class = "indent">The location of the data item in the array. Which is identified with a unique number called an
          <strong><em>INDEX.</em></strong></p>

          We can access individual data inside the array using each piece of data index, or location number.
        </li>
        <li>zero-index - JS goes by 0, 1, 2, 3... since it is assigned like an index with array: triangle, square, pentagon, circle.
          We can identify each one as: 0, 1, 2, 3... and so on.</p>
          <p class = "indent">
          <strong>Code Example:</strong>
          <em>shapes[0];</em> //this will give us triangle since triangle is first. Now we output the whole thing
          together.</p>
          <em>console.log(shapes[0]);</em>
          this would output "triangle".
        </li>
